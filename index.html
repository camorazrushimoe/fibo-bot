                <h2>What is Fibo-bot?</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning English and struggling to remember new words? Fibo-bot is your personal vocabulary retention assistant, right inside Telegram! It‚Äôs not just another flashcard app; it's a smart bot leveraging the power of the <strong>Spaced Repetition System (SRS)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We often forget new information quickly ‚Äì this is the "forgetting curve." Traditional cramming doesn't lead to long-term retention. Fibo-bot solves this by reminding you of words at strategic, increasing intervals (e.g., 1 minute, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days). Each successful recall lengthens the interval, strengthening your memory. If you struggle, the interval shortens. This scientifically proven technique dramatically boosts how you learn and remember English words, almost effortlessly.

                        <strong>Timely Reminders:</strong> At the calculated times, Fibo-bot sends a simple message: "üîî Reminder: [your word/phrase]". This prompts you to actively recall its meaning.
